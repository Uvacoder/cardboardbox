## Information

**Cardboard Box** is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot for my [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/4zJ8xqV) powered by [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org). It comes packaged with many utilities and fun stuff, and even some special moderation functions.

**This bot is not suitable for usage outside of my Discord server!** This repository is primarily for issue tracking and global management between my own devices. If you really, *really* want to run it yourself, read the sections below.

## Adding the bot to your guild

Don't want to run the bot yourself? Simply use [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize/?permissions=8&scope=bot&client_id=618576806177538079) to invite it to your own guild. If you prefer to run it under your own bot name, read the section below.

<h1 align="center">Running it yourself</h1>

If you're really wanting to use this bot yourself, let's go over what you need and how to install it.

## Requirements

- `git` command line. Install by clicking your operating system's name in this list:
  - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - [Macintosh](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- `node` version [8.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org).
- Your **Discord bot token.** Read the first section of [this page](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/the-long-version.html) on how to snag it.

## Installation

1. Head on over to your terminal (preferrably **Command Prompt**) and clone the repository.
   - If you want to clone to a specific folder, you have two options:
	   - **`cd` into your desired folder.** For example, if you wanted to clone the repository into Documents, opening the terminal normally and run `cd C:/Users/<user>/Documents`.
	   - Open the terminal in a specific folder by doing **Shift-Rightclick => Open <Powershell/command terminal> here**.
   - After doing either of those steps, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/rhearmas/cardboardbot.git` through your terminal.
2. When `git` has finished, `cd` into the newly-created folder for the repository.
3. Run `npm install`. This installs all the prerequisites for the bot through **Node package manager**, which is bundled with `node`.
   - If you get any errors about python or msibuild.exe or binding, read the requirements section again and make sure you've installed **everything**.
4. Run `node setup.js` to get a configuration file added.

## Running the bot

Open your terminal and run `node index.js` inside the folder. Don't forget to `cd` into it if the folder isn't in places like your Desktop.

## Getting it to your server

Generate an OAuth link for your bot. Use [this delicious link](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0) to get your link. It even has a calculator for permissions!

- [SharpBot, a selfbot for Discord](https://github.com/RayzrDev/SharpBot) was actually my source for most of these cool commands! Huge kudos to [RayzrDev](https://github.com/RayzrDev) for making a cool selfbot.

- This was initially an edit to [GuideBot, the boilerplate example bot in Discord.js](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot). It has some minor edits to the base code, but most of the basic stuff came from this very example bot.
